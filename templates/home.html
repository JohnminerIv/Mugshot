        <p>Procced to the identifier to upload your own image to see if my model thinks that it is a mug.</p>
        <p>The purpose of mugshot is to make recomendations as to what is and is not a mug. Its kind of a <br>
            personal project to learn more about machine learning and it was fun to train and try to delpoy my own <br>
            model. I hope to expand the model later on to identify more images this is just the first step.</p>
